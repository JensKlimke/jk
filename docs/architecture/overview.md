# System Architecture Overview

This document provides an overview of the JK project's architecture.

## Overview

The JK project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns. The system is organized as a monorepo containing multiple packages that work together to provide a complete application framework.

## High-Level Architecture

The architecture consists of three main component types:

1. **Frontend Applications**: Web applications that provide user interfaces
2. **Backend Services**: Services that provide APIs and other functionality
3. **Shared Libraries**: Common code used by multiple components

These components communicate with each other through HTTP APIs, with frontend applications consuming the APIs provided by the backend services.

```

## Package Structure

The monorepo is organized into different categories of packages:

### Libraries (`packages/libs/`)

Shared code used by multiple packages:

- **models**: Example shared data models and interfaces
- **api-server**: Common API server functionality

### Web Applications (`packages/apps/`)

Frontend applications:

- **app**: Example React frontend application

### Services (`packages/services/`)

Backend services and APIs:

- **api**: Example Express API backend

## Data Flow

1. Frontend applications make HTTP requests to backend services
2. Services process these requests and return JSON responses
3. Frontend applications render the data for the user

## Key Technologies

- **TypeScript**: Used throughout the project for type safety
- **React**: Used for frontend applications (example)
- **Express.js**: Used for backend services (example)
- **Jest**: Used for testing
- **Docker**: Used for containerization
- **Nginx**: Used as a reverse proxy

## Code Sharing

The project uses a monorepo structure to facilitate code sharing between packages:

- Shared libraries define common data structures and functionality used by both frontend and backend components
- The `api-server` package provides common functionality for creating API servers

## Deployment Architecture

When deployed using Docker, the system uses the following architecture:

```
                   ┌─────────────────┐
                   │                 │
                   │  Nginx Reverse  │
                   │     Proxy       │
                   │                 │
                   └─────────────────┘
                           │
                           │
           ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
           │               │               │
           ▼               ▼               ▼
┌─────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │ │                 │ │                 │
│  Frontend App   │ │ Backend Service │ │ Backend Service │
│    Container    │ │    Container    │ │    Container    │
│                 │ │                 │ │                 │
└─────────────────┘ └─────────────────┘ └─────────────────┘
```

The Nginx reverse proxy routes requests to the appropriate service based on the subdomain:
- `app.${DOMAIN}` routes to the frontend app
- `api.${DOMAIN}` routes to the API service
- Additional services can be added with their own subdomains

## Security Considerations

- Backend services use Helmet to add security headers
- CORS is enabled to allow the frontend to communicate with the backend services
- The services are isolated in separate containers

## Scalability

The architecture supports horizontal scaling:
- Each service can be scaled independently
- The Nginx reverse proxy can distribute load across multiple instances of each service
- The stateless nature of the services makes them easy to scale

## Future Enhancements

Potential enhancements to the architecture could include:

- Adding a database for persistent storage
- Implementing authentication and authorization
- Adding a message queue for asynchronous processing
- Implementing a microservices architecture with more specialized services
- Adding a service mesh for more complex service-to-service communication
